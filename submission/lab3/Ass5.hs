-- How can you prove that the sub implementation is correct?
-- We can prove the sub implementation is correct by formulating properties of subsets
-- and testing if these properties are True.
-- From wikipedia we can obtain the following propertiesâˆ·

-- A set X is a subset of Y if and only if their intersection is equal to X.
-- A set X is a subset of Y if and only if their union is equal to Y.
-- A finite set X is a subset of Y if and only if the cardinality of their intersection is equal to the cardinality of X.


-- Test the implementation with two QuickCheck properties.
