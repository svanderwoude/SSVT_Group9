    --       Question: Is the property hard to test? If you find that it is, can you given a reason why?
    --       Answer: One of the reasons the property is hard to test is because of the computational power
    --               it would require for larger numbers, that's why we used small integers.

    --      Question: Give your thoughts on the following issue: when you perform the test
    --                for exercise 4, what are you testing actually? Are you checking a mathematical
    --                fact? Or are you testing whether subsequences satisfies a part of its
    --                specification? Or are you testing something else still?
    --       Answer: In exercise 4 we try to test whether subsequences satisfies a part of its
    --               specification. If the order of the elements in each subsequence does not matter, 
    --               then every subsequence is an element of the powerset of the given sequence. 
    --               If a set A contains n elements, then the powerset of A contains 2ùëõ elements.

    --      Question: Again, give your thoughts on the following issue: when you perform the test
    --                for exercise 5, what are you testing actually? Are you checking a mathematical
    --                fact? Or are you testing whether perms satisfies a part of its
    --                specification? Or are you testing something else still?
    --       Answer: In exercise 5 we try to check for a mathematical fact i.e. there are n! permutations for a 
    --               list of n distinct objects.

    --       Question: How would you test this function, by the way?
    --       Answer: The function takes a number (in this case 10000) and returns a list with numbers that are primes
    --       (with and without reversal), then to test this function we take this list of prime numbers and check if
    --       they satisfy prime condition (with and without reversal) and if all numbers inside the list are true then
    --       the funtion works

    print exc5sumFirst101Primes
    --       Question: Do you have to test that your answer is correct? How could this be checked?
    --       Answer: Testing can be done by creating the sets of 101 consecutive primes starting at the first prime (2).
    --               For each of these sets a unit test can be created, combining the set with if the set produces a prime or not.
    --               The goal of the unit test is to see if the sets that do not produce a prime, indeed do not produce a prime.
    --               And vise versa, the sets that do sum up to a prime, indeed produce a prime.
